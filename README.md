This project is the level 1 Capstone project for the Hyperiondev Full-stack web and software engineer course.
My project website is about Formula 1 which is an interest and hobby of mine.
This website incorporates the use of HTML, CSS, javascript, and jQuery as well as the use of sessionstorage and localstorage in web browsers.
[Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) has been used as a framework for this project.

**NOTE: Firefox does not use localstorage correctly when the site is open and viewed on the local machine. Rather use Chrome.** 
 
* Please refer to the comments in the index.html to locate the custom CSS and javascript files if you want to add CSS or javascript code. **PLEASE DO NOT EDIT THE BOOTSTRAP CSS FILES**

* As this project is a work in progress there remain some features and functions that still need to be developed. The following remains to be completed:
  * contacts.html page - form needs to be linked to a database
  * newsletter.html page - form needs to be linked to a database
  * schedule.HTML page - the remaining races for the year needs to be added.

# Frameworks and libraries
