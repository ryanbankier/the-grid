This project is the level 1 Capestone project for the Hyperiondev Full stack web and software engineer course.
My project webiste is about Formula 1 which is a interest and hobby of mine.
This webiste incorperates the use of html, css, javascript and jQuery as well as the use of sessionstorage and localstorage in web borwsers.
[Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) has been used as a framework for this project.
